CodeGenerator
=============

CodeGenerator is a simple nodejs app that lets you make and export randomly generated codes into text files.

It supports 2 different ways to export, "csv" and "newLine", which do what they say on the tin.

To edit the code go into the app.js and edit the code inside the for statement.

To run it do this: 
     cd CodeGenerator
     node app.js [Number of codes to generate] [file name] [export type]

Thanks for hanging around, catch ya later.
